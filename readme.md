# GIT THINGS I MUST LEARN
-How do I modify things on git 
	-How can I push a file to Git with no issues and how I can remove files from Github without deleting the enitre repository. 
-My issue:
	-after modifying a local file, pushing to Git does not work becasue the existing code is conflicting with the code uploaded to git itself. Could I remove git files or add them without conflicts?
